use
Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER
Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
Number.isSafeInteger()
for setting up id of projectiles, characters and others

so we keep ids in the given interval
[-9007199254740991 , 9007199254740991]
we can start at 0 because it is unlikely we would reach 9007199254740991 in a regular game

use WebRTC rather than webSocket or socketIO
https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/datachannels/

webRTC allow udp/ip data transfert rather than tcp/ip
udp are not reliable but faster to send

webRTC can be used with Socket.IO
